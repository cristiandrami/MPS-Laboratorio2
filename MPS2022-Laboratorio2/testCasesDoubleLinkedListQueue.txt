/**
* Test cases for DoubleLinkedListQueue
* Appending section test cases:
*	appending null node -> Runtime exception
*
*	appending left null node -> Runtime exception
*
*	appending node -> internal size increase of 1 (size++)
*
*	appending node left -> internal size increase of 1 (size++)
*
*	appending node left -> head have to be updated
*		example if we have in list 0 and append left 5, 5 will be the new head (5 0)
*
*	appending node -> head have to be updated
*		example if we have in list 0 and append 5, 5 will be the new tail (0 5)
*
*	one node in list with append() -> head has to be equal to tail 
*
*	one node in list with appendLeft() -> head has to be equal to tail
*
*
* Deleting section test cases:
*	deleting first node on empty list -> Runtime exception
*
*	deleting last node on empty list -> Runtime exception
*
*	deleting first node on empty list -> internal size decrease of 1 (size--)
*
*	deleting last node on empty list -> internal size decrease of 1 (size--)
*
*	deleting first node on list that have only one node -> head has to be updated to null
*
*	deleting last node on list that have only one node -> tail has to be updated to null
*
*	deleting first node on list that have only one node -> tail has to be updated to null
*
*	deleting last node on list that have only one node -> head has to be updated to null
*
*	deleting first node -> head have to be updated
*		example if we have in list 0 5 and delete first, 5 will be the new head (5)
*
*	deleting last node -> tail have to be updated
*		example if we have in list 0 5 and delete last 5, 0 will be the new tail (0)
